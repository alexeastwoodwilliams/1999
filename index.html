    <h2>Alex’s Diary</h2>
    <ul><li><strong>31/12/1999 10:37pm:</strong> This will be my last diary entry because, well, obviously by tomorrow computers won't be working because of Y2K. I was invited out to party tonight and originally I wasn't going to go but then I thought well if the world is ending anyway, I've always wanted to try drinking turpentine so why not head out and give it a try?</li>
      <li><strong>31/12/1999 09:42am:</strong> Russia has a new President! "Vladimir Putin" is is name. He seems like a nice guy. I'm sure he'll protect Russia's fledgling democracy and won't turn out to be a psychotic dictator or start any wars. Russia's days of being a global pariah are definitely behind it.</li>
<li><strong>25/12/1999, 11:00 AM:</strong> Merry Christmas! Just got a PlayStation. Can’t believe how realistic games are now — graphics probably can’t get much better than this!</li>
<li><strong>01/12/1999 02:21pm</strong> I just took out my life savings and invested them into a company called "Enron". I don't know what it is but they seem really trustworthy. Well okay not really. I'm not an idiot! I still kept some of my shares in Blockbuster - it's important to have some money invested in a stable company that you know will be around forever.</li>
<li><strong>26/11/1999 09.48am:</strong> Tomorrow is the New Zealand election. I think Jenny Shipley is gonna lose, obviously, but I also think this will be the end of Winston Peters's political career. There's no way he'll ever survive this or come back from it and I think 1999 is the last time anyone in New Zealand will ever hear his name.</li>
      <li><strong>04/11/1999 12:13pm:</strong> I have a friend in Florida who says he won't bother voting in next year's Presidential election. I don't blame him. It's obvious that Al Gore is gonna win and it's not like his vote will count anyway.</li>
<li><strong>09/10/1999 09:29pm:</strong> Apparently Donald Trump (that rich guy property guy in New York) is thinking of running for President. There's no way in hell Americans will ever vote for him. It's sort of like how they'll probably never elect an African American. There are just some people who will never, ever be President. On the bright side, I reckon we'll definitely have a woman President within the next 5 years!</li>
<li><strong>11/09/1999 04:21pm:</strong> I just bought a lifetime pass to visit the Twin Towers in New York. It was very expensive but hey, it's not like two big buildings like that are ever going away, right?</li>
      <li><strong>27/08/1999 03:34pm</strong> It absolutely disgusts me that Bill Clinton is still in office. Sexual activity between two consenting adults!? That's the worst thing a President has ever done! I'm surprised he's not in jail.</li>
      <li><strong>12/08/1999 07:31pm:</strong> Do you know who I think is a really good role model for kids? Bill Cosby. You can tell he's just a really decent person, just like Jimmy Saville.</li>
<li><strong>10/07/1999 12:52pm:</strong> I saw a Concorde flying overhead today. I wonder what planes will be like 20 years from now? I bet they'll all be supersonic, probably even faster than Concorde.</li>
<li><strong>28/06/1999 08:02pm:</strong> House prices in Auckland are INSANE!!! $230,000 for a three bedroom house!?!?!? I think I'll wait to buy - I'm sure they'll be much cheaper in a few years.</li>
<li><strong>23/06/1999 05:41pm:</strong> Tony Blair might be the greatest British Prime Minister of all time. He hasn't put a foot wrong and I can't imagine him ever doing anything stupid to derail his perfect legacy. History books will sing his praises for years to come!</li>
<li><strong>02/06/1999 07:32pm:</strong> Just downloaded Napster. Wow! Free music forever! And no downsides whatsoever!</li>
<li><strong>15/05/1999 11:41pm:</strong> I just watched that new show "South Park". It was hilarious but I know I have to enjoy it while it lasts - there's no way a show that rude is going to survive for very long.</li>
<li><strong>04/05/1999 06:07pm:</strong> Just bought tickets to see "Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace". I bet it's really good. In fact it'll probably be even better than the original trilogy!</li>
<li><strong>29/04/1999 09:22pm:</strong> Just applied for a job at Pets.com. They're gonna be huge! I can feel it.</li>
<li><strong>05/04/1999 10:39pm:</strong> Apple Computers are finished. Who in their right mind is gonna buy one of those weird coloured computers? It's sad but their bankruptcy is inevitable at this point.</li>
<li><strong>11/03/1999 4:07 PM:</strong> Just bought a book on Amazon. Cool idea, but they’re still pretty niche. I give them two years, tops.
